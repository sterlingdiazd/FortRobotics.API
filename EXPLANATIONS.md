# FORT Technical Exercise

## Setup

- There are no automated tests for the functionality because I haven't used docker before. Learnt the basics and deployed the project, but had some issues with database connectivity. All the configurations were done to create, connect and use the database, but it did not connected as expected. I tried preparing the migrations, and then in the startup execute in runtime the creation of the database. It works, but do not connect. However, following the Setup instructions, and using the postman collection, the api could be tested easily.

- To test the functionality of the API, it's needed to clone the repository and run it in VS Code.
  The program will manage all required functionality.
  As long as the dabatase, user database and password are allowed in runing maching, the program will working correctly.
